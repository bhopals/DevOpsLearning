DOCKER ENGINE : 

    Client - Docker Cli - (From where you execute the command.)
    Rest API - REGISTRY (docker hub)

When you run "docker run hello-world" on the command prompt, following things happened:


To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.


Docker Universal Control Panel (UCP):
  Only comes with docker EE version (Enterprise Edition)
  It helps us to manage multiple nodes/machine with docker engine running

  UCP provides below features:
    - Private image Registry called Docker Trusted Registry
    - Secure and access use Management
    - Application and cluster Management
    - Image security scanning and continuous monitoring
    - Content trust and verification
    - Policy Management


Docker user Namespace for container isolation.
Moreover, Docker also uses CGroups (Control Groups) for controlling container resources, primarily around CPU and Memory.


To Run Ubuntu Images:
docker container run -it ubuntu



Docker Public Repository - Docker hub

To login into docker hub.

Configuration
-------------------
run "docker login"
It will ask for username and password. Once successfully logged in, pull sample images to local from public dockerhub repository.

    docker pull <image-name>
    docker pull alphine

Once the image is downloaded, you can check by running "docker images". It will list out all the images/repository.

Now we will tag the downloaded image with some other id.

    docker tag <first_three_letter_of_image_id> <username>/<image-name/repository-name>:<newtagname>

    docker tag af0 bhopalsingh/alphine:linkedtag1
    docker tag af0 bhopalsingh/alphine:linkedtag2
    docker tag af0 bhopalsingh/alphine:linkedtag3

Here we have created 3 copies of the same repository.

Now we need to push these repositories up to Docker Hub, and to do that, execute following command.

    docker push <username>/<repository-name>
    docker push bhopalsingh/alphine



To delete docker images 
    docker images (it will list out all the Images)
    docker image rm <first_three_letter_of_image_id> -f 

Once deleted, we can fetch the copy from docker hub by

    docker pull <username>/<repository-name>:<tagname>
    docker pull bhopalsingh/alphine:linkedin1

So above demo was about: (push and pull images back and forth)
    - creating a docker repositories on local
    - push the repository to docker Hub
    - pull it back to local


Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP)

To Back up DOCKER, we need to take back up of following things:

    - Docker Swarm Cluster
    - Universal Control Plane (UCP)
    - Docker Truster Registry (DTR)
    - Container Volume Data

    

Install DTR - Docker Trusted Registry

docker run -it --rm docker/dtr:2.4.12 install --ucp-insecure-tls


Some useful commands to know the staus of your docker command.

    docker info
    docker version
    docker ps
    docker ps -a
