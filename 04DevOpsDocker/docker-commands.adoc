=== Docker Basic Commands 

    $ sudo docker pull -a busybox

Here -a flag ensures the fetching of all the variants (versions) of the image.
The "busybox" is the registry here.

    $ sudo docker pull busybox

If we dont pass this flag then docker will fetch only image which is tagged with latest.

But if tou want to download the image varient other than the latest then you need to pass the tag details along with the repository
$ sudo docker pull busybox:ubuntu-10.2.3


To Search for any Docker image 
    
    $ sudo docker search mysql


    $ docker run -i -t ubunut:latest /bin/bash

The command variable we access the details of the IMAGE 

/# id 

/# hostname
