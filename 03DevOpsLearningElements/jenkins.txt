Jenkins Beginner Tutorial 1 - Introduction and Getting Started
==================================================

Jenkins 
  - java application
  - used for continuous integration and continuous delivery


Step 1 : Download Jenkins war file - https://jenkins.io/

Step 2 : Place the war file into any location on your system

Step 3 : goto command prompt (windows) | terminal (mac)
   - goto folder where jenkins.war is
   - java -jar jenkins.war

Step 4 : goto browser - http://localhost:8080 (Jenkins window should show up)

Jenkins Beginner Tutorial 2 - How to setup Jenkins on Tomcat
 ==================================================

Why?
Running Jenkins standalone (jetty/winstone) vs Running Jenkins on Tomcat

Pre-requisite
***Tomcat 5 or above***
***java(7 or above) should be available***
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqpmH...)

Step 1 : Download Tomcat 

Step 2 : Unzip and place tomcat folder at any location

Step 3 : Copy/Place the jenkins.war file inside tomcat/webapps folder

Step 4 : Goto commandpromt (cmd) - windows  |  terminal - mac
  - goto tomcat/bin directory
  - make all files executable : chmod +x *.sh

In case of windows this command will not work. This step might not be needed if you are on windows. Else you can right click on the file/folder goto security tab and change the permissions.

Difference between Build and Delivery Pipeline:

At a high level you can say Build pipeline has a smaller scope in terms of the entire process of software dev and delivery whereas delivery pipeline has a much broader scope. Also when we say delivery, build pipeline will be one of its components.
Build Pipeline provides a view of the upstream and downstream jobs setup for the build process (typically)
Whereas Delivery Pipeline gives the visualization of the complete Delivery Process that may include Build, Deploy, Test. In the delivery pipeline view, you can see each of these sections in a separate box.
Just have a look here:

Jenkins Pipeline
================================================

First Pipeline code (Groovy Language)
------------------------

pipeline {
           agent any
           stages {
                stage("Hello") {
                     steps {
                          echo 'Hello World'
                     }
                }
           }
      }


Parameterized Pipeline
---------------------------
pipeline {
    agent any
    parameters {
        string(name: 'Greeting', defaultValue: 'Hello', description: 'How should I greet the world?')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            steps {
                echo "${params.Greeting} World!"
            }
        }
    }
}

Once JOB is created, at the time of Running, use "Build with parameters"  Option



Connecting Jenkins to GitHub
=======================================

Go to github and create a token from "developer setting" page. Ensure to select access of webhooks and notification services as well as repo code 
Once token is generated, copy that and go to Jenkins --> Manage Jenkins --> Configure System --> Git --> add credential --> OKyS50B0O9nZorXBMvXve9r7SLx8MTU2Mjc0NDcxM0AxNTYyNjU4MzEz
https://github.com/settings/tokens



WebHook Build Configurations
======================================
# We'll need to get a personal API key from our git repo
#1, create a fork of this repository:

https://github.com/robertstarmer/jenkins-git.git

# creating

https://github.com/{your_github_user_name}/jenkins-git.git
#2, in github, get a personal access token:

https://github.com/settings/tokens

#3, when creating the token, add:
admin:repo_hook
repo:*
notifications:*

#4 after configuring jenkins, verify that the webhook
# was created
https://github.com/{your_github_user_name}/jenkins-git/settings/hooks




REST API Jenkins
======================================
# Triggering a build via REST
#1 We need a token from the Jenkins UI:
Admin->Configure->Show API Token

#2 We need a CSRF crumb
curl --user "admin:TOKEN" 'http://jenkins.kumulus.co:8080/crumbIssuer/api/xml?xpath=concat(//crumbRequestField,":",//crumb)'
# grab the entire string from Jenkins-Crumb:...

#3 We can now trigger a build
curl -X POST http://jenkins.kumulus.co:8080/job/multi-step/build --user admin:TOKEN --data-urlencode json='' -H "Jenkins-Crumb:....."
