Ansible is an IT automation tool. It can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate more advanced IT 
tasks such as continuous deployments or zero downtime rolling updates.

Ansible’s main goals are simplicity and ease-of-use. It also has a strong focus on security and reliability, 
featuring a minimum of moving parts, usage of OpenSSH for transport (with other transports and pull modes as 
alternatives), and a language that is designed around auditability by humans–even those not familiar with the program.
