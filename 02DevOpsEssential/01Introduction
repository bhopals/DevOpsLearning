DevOps Culture

 -  DevOps culture is about collaboration between Dev and Ops.
 -  Under the traditional separation between Dev and Ops, Dev and Ops have different and opposing goals.
    Dev - Speedy Delivery
    Ops - Stability

The Goals of DevOps Culture With DevOps:
• Dev and Ops are playing on the same team
• Dev and Ops share the same goals

These goals include things like:
• Fast time-to-market (TTM)
• Few production failures
• Immediate recovery from failures

The Goals of DevOps Culture:
    -   DevOps is about Dev and Ops working together.
    -   In a DevOps culture, devs care about stability as well as speed, and ops care about speed as well as
        stability.
    -   The traditional roles of developers and operational engineers can even become blurred under DevOps.
    -   Instead of “throwing code over the wall,” dev and ops work together to create and use tools and
        processes that support both speed and stability.
    -   DevOps recognizes that dev and ops are more powerful when they are together!
