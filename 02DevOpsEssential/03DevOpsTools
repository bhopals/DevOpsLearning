Build Automation Tools
==================================

    • Build automation – Automated processing of code in preparation for deployment
    • What tools you use for build automation usually depend on programming languages and frameworks

    A few examples:
    • Java – ant, maven, gradle
    • Javascript – npm, grunt, gulp
    • Make – widely used in Unix-based systems
    • Packer – build machine images and containers

Configuration Management Tools
================================================
    
    • Configuration Management – Managing and changing the state of pieces of infrastructure in a
    consistent and maintainable way
    • Configuration management tools are a great way to implement infrastructure as code

Virtualization Tools
=======================================
    • Virtualization – Managing resources by creating virtual rather than physical machines
    • Hypervisor – Runs on bare metal and manages virtual machines (VMs)
    
    • Examples:
    
    • VMWare ESX and ESXi
    • Microsoft Hyper-V
    • Citrix XenServer

Containerization
=================================

    • Containers – Lightweight, isolated packages containing everything needed to run a piece of software
    • Require fewer resources than VMs –VMs contain an entire OS plus virtual versions of all the
    hardware
    • Containers have the bare minimum needed to run the software
    • Docker – Docker is currently the leading container technology
    • Containers are still relatively new but very useful for DevOps!


Monitoring Tools
===================================

    • Monitoring – Collecting and presenting data about the state and performance of applications
    • There are different types of monitoring:
    • Infrastructure monitoring – focuses on things related to infrastructure
    • Examples: CPU, ram
    • Application Performance Monitoring (APM) – focuses on performance and stability of individual parts of an
    application
    • Examples: response times, logs

Orchestration Tools (Scale up and scale down of resources)
==============================================================
• Orchestration – automation that supports processes and workflows, such as provisioning resources.
• Lets you do things like:
• Scale up and scale down applications on request
• Auto scale applications based on usage
• Create self-healing systems by spinning down unhealthy nodes and replacing them with new ones


Orchestration Tools
    Docker Swarm:
        • Docker-native
        • Orchestration for Docker containers

    Kubernetes:
        • Open source
        • Orchestration server
        • Manage containerized apps across multiple hosts

    Zookeeper:
        • Open source – Apache foundation
        • Can work alongside Kubernetes
        • Offers a centralized service registry that integrates with orchestration features

    Terraform:
        • Combines orchestration and infrastructure-as-code
        • Works well with other tools, like Ansible
        • Works well with AWS
        • Integrates with Kubernetes
