In Linux everything is stored as a file


In Windows we have MY Computer and then C:/D: Drives

In Linux the parent directory is ROOT Directory (/) - The top most directory

    ROOT(/)
        /home---: default directory of normal user:
        Ex: dhoni
                /home/dhoni
        /root -- sepecially for root user.
        /ecc -- it container all configuration files
                /etc/passwd
                c:/windows/system32/drivers
        /boot	all bootable are available here
        
        /bin --commands which exe.by all the users
        /sbin--it contains the commands it is exculsively for the root.
        
        /dev   all device files	
                printer, hard disk cd rom
        /proc it conatins all process files
        /mnt   it is a default mount point for your external storage devices
        /usr default softwares are installed in this location
            c:\program files
        

To Switch user 

    sudo su -  

    here sudo - Super User Do 
    su - Switch user 

When you login to linxu if $ is appearing then normal user and if # is appearing then its Super User.

To know about logged in User - whoami


Three types of file type 

    - Files - txt, doc files

        files(text files):
-------------------
        >> how to create file:
	    how to edit
	    how to delete fixed
	
        cat command : concatenate
        
                cat [options] file_ame
                create the file	 cat > filename
                    Once done with the content, press CTRL + C or D to exit the editor.

                append the text  cat >> filename

                display the file(important)  cat filename
        
                cat -n name 
                    - Will open the file with line number.

                "cat" command drawbacks. 
                    - It will always append at the end of the file (cat >> <file-name>).
                    - While entering text in the file, the backspace will not work.


                **To know more about the command, use "man <command-name>"

        touch command	
                - Only to create new files 
                    touch file1 file2 file3  
                        3 files created 

                    touch file{1...100}
                        - it will create file1, file2...file100 with just one commands 

        To remove created files 

            rm <file-name>
            rm -rf <file-name> (Remove file recursively and forcefully. will not ask for Y/N Confirmation)
            rm -rf one.* (Delete all matching file / directories)


    - Directories - Folders
    - Link Files (Soft and Hard Link Files)  - Shortcut Files 



ls - List files (minimal infromation)
ll - List files with permission and other details as well.

press "cd" command to go to the root directory anytime.


To Add new user in Linux Machine

"useradd <user-name>"

To check the added user details : 
    cat /etc/passwd

  It will return all the login details of all the users.


To assign password to newly created user
    passwd <user-name>
    passwd sachin (now it will ask for the password and confirm the password. Thats it)


To switch user in Linux
    su <user-name>

To Delete User 

    userdel <user-name>

    userdel sachin


Directory/File permission:

mkdir test
ll test 



-rw-r--r-- 

 r - Readable
 w - Writable
 x - Executable
 - - Denied

 in "-rw-r--r--" 
    "-" first denotes its directory
    "rw-" denotes permission for person who created it
    "r--" permission for Group
    "r--" (last one) Permission for others (except the user who created )

 RWX = 241 (both way can be used)
 R - 2
 W - 4
 X - 1
  Total is 7 if you want to give full permission

chmod 777 <file-name>
This will give full permission to Created User, Groups, and other users

To give only created user we need to run "chmod 722" (Read only for Group and others)


Other way to update permissions is:

chmod u+x <file-name> (Adding Execute permission to Main user )
chmod g-x <file-name>(Removing execute permission for the Group users)
u - Created User 
g - Group
o - Other 


VI Mode :

vi <file-name>, once file is opened, press "i" for activating INSERT mode.
Enter the details. Once done editing. Press ESC then :wq to quit the editor.
