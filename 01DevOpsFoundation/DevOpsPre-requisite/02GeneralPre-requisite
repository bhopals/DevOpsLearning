Configuration Management (CHEF):
    - Automation Tool - Chef, Puppet, Ansible
    - There are two models of configuration management tool. 
        Push Based Deployment Model - Master Server Pushes the configuration and softwares to the individual servers. Push is 
            initiated by the master node. Example of such tools are Sensible, Salk stack

        Pull Based Deployement model - Individual server contact a Master Server, establish connections and 
        download the softwares and configurations, and then configure themselves accordingly. Configuration Pull is initiated by Agents at regular interval.
        Examples are puppet and chef.

    - TWO fundamental characteristics of Automation Tools:
        - Idempotency  - Task yeild the same result when repeated multiple times
        - Convergence  - the process or state of converging.

    - Why we need Automation Script?
        - No Complex Scripting
        - Consistent in Heterogeneous Environment
        - Imperative and Declarative Patterns
        - Idempotent

            - Server-Client Deployment model  - For Production use case only
        
        - The Primary Responsibility of chef is to maintain defined state or desired state configurations.
        - Chef helps in maximizing business productivity by automating regular repetitive tasks.
