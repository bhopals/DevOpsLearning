1. Lab Environment - Home Setup - (Oracle ) VirtualBox  - To setup Lab environment on Local Machine



In this first we will install install a virtual box on the machine and then install Ubuntu software on it. 

Why is Virtualization useful?
    -   Running multiple operating systems simultaneously. 
    -   Easier software installations. 
    -   Testing and disaster recovery. 
    -   Infrastructure consolidation. 

Virtualization Terminiology
    -   Host operating system (host OS). 
    -   Guest operating system (guest OS).
    -   Virtual machine (VM). 
    -   Guest Additions. 
    -   Desktop Virtualization
- Hypervisor/VMM (Virtual Machine Moniter)
    - Hypervisor is a special software product that can simultaneously run multiple virtual machines on a physical machine.
        The VMs are logically isolated from each other and the underlying physical machine; 
        this is due to the abstraction layer of a hypervisor that makes VMs independent from the hardware that is
        used by a physical machine. This setup enables one of the advantages of virtualization – easy copying
        machines from one host to another. 
        Another benefit is hardware resource redistribution between VMs.

    -  Oracle provides VirtualBox as a hypervisor for running virtual machines (VMs).
    -  The hypervisor is a software that can virtualize the hardware resources. For example Oracle VirtualBox, Fusion VMvare
       There are two types of hypervisors:
         - Type 1 hypervisor: hypervisors run directly on the system hardware – A “bare metal” embedded hypervisor.
                A type 1 hypervisor doesn’t require an underlying operating system (OS) because the hypervisor works as the operating system in this case. Using type 1 is optimal for large production environments.
         - Type 2 hypervisor: hypervisors run on a host operating system that provides virtualization services, such as I/O device support and memory management.
                A  type 2 hypervisor runs on an existing host operating system as an application. 
                This type provides virtualization services by coordinating calls for CPU, memory, disk, and other 
                I/O (input/output) resources through the host OS. Using a type 2 hypervisor is convenient for users who want to run a VM on their personal computers.



Below are the steps :

    A. Download Oracle Windows host on the machine. To do that, go to https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads and select "Windows Host Machine" and Install that.
    
    B. Once installed, we need to deploy the OS Image which we want to install on the Virtual box

    C. Go to https://www.osboxes.org/, which has readily images of operating systems. Navigate to VirtualBox Images and select Ubuntu.
        Download link : https://sourceforge.net/projects/osboxes/files/v/vb/55-U-u/16.04/16.04.6/1604.664.7z/download
        Once downloaded, extract the folder.
    
    D. Open Oracle Virtaul Box, and click on "Create" to create a new Virtual Machine. Enter "Ubuntu" or any
    guest OS you want to install. Click on next, ensure you select atleast 2GB memory for the OS (Recommended one).
    After that, select the option "Use an existing Virtual Hard Disk" and select the downloaded Ubuntu image and click on CREATE.

    E. Once created, go to settings --> NETWORK --> Attached NETWORK --> Select attached to "Bridged Adapter" instead of NAT Network option.

    F. One more setting before kicking off the guest OS is "Take a snapshot" to ensure a proper back of the installed version which
       can be used to restore if required.

    G. Start the OS. Once done Login screen will be opened, enter "osboxes.org" username and password and LOGIN.
        - if unable to start then please follow below  steps (Windows 10):
            1) open command prompt as Administrator
            2) run bcdedit to check hypervisor status:
            3) if is set to auto then disable it:
                bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off
            4) reboot host machine and launch VirtualBox again


    E. Go to Virtual OS terminal and find the IP Address by running "ifconfig" command.

    F. Now go to Host machine and install cmd tool for SSH (putty, MobaXterm etc). Here we are going to use MobaXterm

    G. Once installed, we are going to use this from host machine to connect to our virtual host. To do that, we will create a new SSH session by entering ipAddress of 
        Guest OS and username "osboxes". 
    
    ** If connection refused then please ensure that you have ssh service up and running on VM.
     - To check ssh service status : service ssh status  (To check the service status)
     - sudo su (Enter the password "osboxes.org")
     - apt-get update
     - apt-get install openssh-server
     - service ssh status (Check to see the service is installed and active/running or not)
     - Once done, go to MobaXterm ssh terminal and try to login into the session.

    If you are having trouble in running "apt-get update" then try to change Virtual Box Network Settings to NAT from Bridged network.
    Once installed, revert the network settings to "Bridge Adapter".

    E. Enter the password when prompted and you are already In. 





2. Lab Environment Cloud Setup  - Setup  Puppet environment on Cloud - To Deploy AWS instances

    A. Create a free tier account on AWS cloud  (https://aws.amazon.com/)

    B. Once login, select the REGION from top right corner. Each region has 2 availibility zones which are the
       physical data center for any region.
    
    C. Now go to SERVICES tab and select "EC2" which is AWS cloud computing service.

    D. Click on Launch Intance then choose AMI (Amazon Machine Instance) screen appears. Then click on "Community Amis"
        and search for "centos7.4" image. The next screen will show Intance type where you can select different configuration for your machine.

    E.
